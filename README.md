This repository contains selected material from a set of (~400 page) Linear Algebra self-study project, written after taking an undergraduate Linear Algebra course over the following Summer. 

The notes focus on creating original explanations and diagrammatic visualisations created using LaTeX, based on initial ideas provided by the 3Blue1Brown Linear Algebra series, but extending these ideas to more practical and rigorous applications. The project deepened understanding of vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalue problems, inner products, and matrix methods beyond core coursework. 

A short preview of the notes is included here. Due to file size constraints, the complete notes are hosted externally and are accessible via the link provided.
